# Simple FB2 to EPUB converter written on C++ #

fb2toepub is a converter from FB2 to EPUB. FB2 and EPUB are two popular eBook formats.
This converter is intended to be used in embedded systems and other resource-critical facilities, however of course it can be used as a standalone application.

Tested on Windows Vista 32 and Cygwin.

For Linux, use Makefile.

For Windows, use fb2toepub.sln which is a solution file for MSVS 2008. (There are some build issues for Windows. See README file for details.)
